#### Notes on Supported response modes
1. `direct_post` : 
   - Authorization Response is sent as a POST request to the `response_uri` endpoint. Authorization Response is attached as request body in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` HTTP content type
2. `direct_post.jwt` : 
   - Authorization Response is sent as a POST request to the `response_uri` endpoint. 
   - Authorization Response is attached as request body in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` HTTP content type. 
   - The response is encrypted using the public key provided in the client_metadata of the authorization request.
   - The created JWE's header contains the `apu` (producer info) as wallet generated nonce (with entropy 16 bytes) and `apv` (recipient info) as the verifier nonce i.e., the nonce received in the authorization request.

## Specifications supported
- The implementation follows OpenID for Verifiable Presentations - draft 21 and draft23 .[Specification-21](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html) [Specification-23](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-23.html).
- The library validates the client_id and client_id_scheme parameters in the authorization request according to the relevant specification.
- If the client_id_scheme parameter is included in the authorization request, the request is treated as conforming to Draft 21, and validation is performed accordingly.
- If the client_id_scheme parameter is not included, the request is interpreted as following Draft 23, and validation is applied based on that specification.

- Below are the fields we expect in the authorization request based on the client id scheme as part of draft 21,
  - Client_id_scheme is **_pre-registered_**
    * client_id
    * client_id_scheme
    * presentation_definition/presentation_definition_uri
    * response_type
    * response_mode
    * nonce
    * state
    * response_uri
    * client_metadata (Optional)

  - Client_id_scheme is **_redirect_uri_**
    * client_id
    * client_id_scheme
    * presentation_definition/presentation_definition_uri
    * response_type
    * nonce
    * state
    * redirect_uri
    * client_metadata (Optional)
    
  - **_Request Uri_** is also supported as part of this version.
    - When request_uri is passed as part of the authorization request, below are the fields we expect in the authorization request,
        * client_id
        * client_id_scheme
        * request_uri
        * request_uri_method
    
- Below are the fields we expect in the authorization request based on the client id scheme as part of draft 23,
  - Client_id_scheme is **_pre-registered_**
    * client_id
    * presentation_definition/presentation_definition_uri
    * response_type
    * response_mode
    * nonce
    * state
    * response_uri
    * client_metadata (Optional)

  - Client_id_scheme is **_redirect_uri_**
    * client_id
    * presentation_definition/presentation_definition_uri
    * response_type
    * nonce
    * state
    * redirect_uri
    * client_metadata (Optional)
    
  - **_Request Uri_** is also supported as part of this version.
  - When request_uri is passed as part of the authorization request, below are the fields we expect in the authorization request,
     * client_id
     * request_uri
     * request_uri_method
   
  - The request uri can return either a jwt token/encoded if it is a jwt the signature is verified as mentioned in the specification.
  - The client id and client id scheme from the authorization request and the client id and client id scheme received from the response of the request uri should be same.

**Note** : The pre-registered client id scheme validation can be toggled on/off based on the optional boolean which you can pass to the authenticateVerifier methods shouldValidateClient parameter. This is false by default.
## Functionalities
- Decode and parse the Verifier's encoded Authorization Request received from the Wallet.
- Authenticates the Verifier using the received clientId and returns the valid Presentation Definition to the Wallet.
- Receives the list of verifiable credentials(VC's) from the Wallet which are selected by the end user based on the credentials requested as part of Verifier Authorization request.
- Constructs the verifiable presentation and send it to wallet for generating Json Web Signature (JWS).
- Receives the signed Verifiable presentation and sends a POST request with generated vp_token and presentation_submission to the Verifier response_uri endpoint.


  **Note** : Fetching Verifiable Credentials by passing [Scope](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html#name-using-scope-parameter-to-re) param in Authorization Request is not supported by this library.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

From Version release-0.4.x onward:

### API contract changes
This library has undergone some changes in its API contract. 

#### 1. Instantiation of OpenID4VP
- The OpenID4VP class is now initialized with `traceabilityId` and `walletMetadata` parameters.
  - traceabilityId: Used to track the traceability of the requests and responses.
  - walletMetadata: Metadata which wallet supports, such that client-id-scheme support, vp format support, proof type support, etc. (See [walletMetadata construction](#walletmetadata-construction) below for details)

```swift
let openID4VP = OpenID4VP(traceabilityId: "trace-id", walletMetadata: WalletMetadata)
```

#### 2. Construction of WalletMetadata
- The WalletMetadata construction has now been simplified. You can create a WalletMetadata object with the required parameters exposed as constants.
- In detail,
- `WalletMetadata` is now a struct that contains the following properties:
  - `presentationDefinitionURISupported`: Bool
  - `vpFormatsSupported`: [String: VPFormatSupported]
  - `clientIdSchemesSupported`: [ClientIdScheme]
  - `requestObjectSigningAlgValuesSupported`: [RequestSigningAlgorithm]?
  - `authorizationEncryptionAlgValuesSupported`: [KeyManagementAlgorithm]?
  - `authorizationEncryptionEncValuesSupported`: [ContentEncryptionAlgorithm]?

```swift
let walletMetadata = try WalletMetadata(presentationDefinitionURISupported: true,
                                        vpFormatsSupported: [
                                            .ldp_vc: VPFormatSupported(
                                                algValuesSupported: ["Ed25519Signature2018", "Ed25519Signature2020"]
                                            ),
                                            .mso_mdoc: VPFormatSupported(
                                                algValuesSupported: ["ES256"]
                                            )
                                        ],
                                        clientIdSchemesSupported: [.preRegistered, .redirectUri, .did],
                                        requestObjectSigningAlgValuesSupported: [.edDsa],
                                        authorizationEncryptionAlgValuesSupported: [.ecdhEs],
                                        authorizationEncryptionEncValuesSupported: [.A256GCM])
```

3. The `shouldValidateClient` parameter in `authenticateVerifier` now defaults to true.
- If your integration previously relied on it being false, you must now explicitly pass false to preserve the old behavior.
- Example (updated usage)

```swift
 let authorizationRequest : AuthorizationRequest = try await openID4VP.authenticateVerifier(
                urlEncodedAuthorizationRequest: testValidUrlEncodedVPRequestWithRedirectUri,
                trustedVerifierJSON: trustedVerifiers),
                walletMetadata: walletMetadata,
                shouldValidateClient: false // explicitly set to false if you want to skip client validation
            )
```

## Construction of OpenID4VP instance

- The OpenID4VP class is initialized with `traceabilityId` and `walletMetadata` parameters.

```swift
let openID4VP = OpenID4VP(traceabilityId: "trace-id", walletMetadata: WalletMetadata)
```

### WalletMetadata construction
- The WalletMetadata is a struct that contains metadata about the wallet's capabilities and supported features.
- It is used to inform the Verifier about the wallet's capabilities when processing authorization requests.
- The WalletMetadata will be sent to the verifier while making a POST request to the `request_uri` endpoint if the authorization request contains `request_uri` and `request_uri_method` as `post`.

```swift

**Notes**
- Wallet can send the entire metadata, library will customize it as per authorization request client_id_scheme. Eg - in case pre-registered, library modifies wallet metadata to be sent without request object signing info properties as specified in the specification.

## APIs

### authenticateVerifier
 - Receives a list of trusted verifiers & Verifier's encoded Authorization request from consumer app(mobile wallet).
 - Takes an optional boolean to toggle the client validation.
 - Decodes and parse the request, extracts the clientId and verifies it against trusted verifier's list clientId.
 - If the data contains request_uri and request_uri_method as post, then the wallet metadata is shared in the request body while making an api call to request_uri for fetching authorization request.
 - The library also validates the incoming authorization request with the wallet metadata
 - Returns the validated Authorization request object


```swift
    let authorizationRequest : AuthorizationRequest = try authenticateVerifier(urlEncodedAuthorizationRequest: String, trustedVerifierJSON: [Verifier], shouldValidateClient: Bool)
```

###### Example usage

```swift
 let trustedVerifiers: [Verifier] = [Verifier(clientId: "https://mock-verifier.com", responseUris:["https://mock-verifier.com/response"]

 let authorizationRequest : AuthorizationRequest = try await openID4VP.authenticateVerifier(
                urlEncodedAuthorizationRequest: testValidUrlEncodedVPRequestWithRedirectUri,
                trustedVerifierJSON: trustedVerifiers),
                walletMetadata: walletMetadata,
                shouldValidateClient: true
            )
```


###### Exceptions

1. DecodingException is thrown when there is and issue while decoding the Authorization Request
2. InvalidQueryParams exception is thrown if
    - query params are not present in the Request
    - there is a issue while extracting the params
    - both presentation_definition and presentation_definition_uri are present in Request
    - both presentation_definition and presentation_definition_uri are not present in Request
3. MissingInput exception is thrown if any of required params are not present in Request
4. InvalidInput exception is thrown if any of required params value is empty
5. InvalidVerifier exception is thrown if the received request client_id & response_uri are not matching with any of the trusted verifiers
6. JWTVerification exception is thrown if there is any error in extracting public key, kid or signature verification failure.
7. InvalidData exception is thrown if 
   - `response_mode` is not supported
   - For `direct_post.jwt` response mode
     - client_metadata is not available
     - unable to find the public key JWK from the `jwks` of `client_metadata` as per the provided algorithm in `client_metadata`

This method will also notify the Verifier about the error by sending it to the response_uri endpoint over http post request. If response_uri is invalid and validation failed then Verifier won't be able to know about it.


### constructUnsignedVPToken
- Receives a dictionary of input_descriptor id & list of verifiable credentials for each input_descriptor that are selected by the end-user.
- Creates a vp_token without proof using received input_descriptor IDs and verifiable credentials, then returns its string representation to consumer app(mobile wallet) for signing it.

```swift
    let unsignedVPTokens = try openID4VP.constructUnsignedVPToken(credentialsMap: [String: [FormatType: Array<Any>]])
```

| credentialsMap | [String: [FormatType: Array<Any>]] |   Yes    | N/A           | A Map which contains input descriptor id as key and value is the map of credential format and the list of user selected verifiable credentials |

###### Example usage

```swift
let unsignedVPTokens: [FormatType: UnsignedVPToken] = try openID4VP.constructUnsignedVPToken(
    credentialsMap: [
        "input_descriptor_id": [
            FormatType.ldp_vc.rawValue: [["id": "uuid-1234-1234", //....]],
